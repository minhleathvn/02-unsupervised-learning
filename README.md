## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your Python environment and start working with the notebooks.

### 1. Setup Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

* **Create the environment** (named `.venv`):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

* **Activate the environment:**
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\Activate
        ```

### 2. Install Requirements

Once the environment is active, install the necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start Jupyter Notebook

To start the Jupyter Notebook server, open your terminal (with the virtual environment activated) and run:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
